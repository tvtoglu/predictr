# Installation and Usage
### Step 1: Download Anaconda
The easiest way to install Python is by downloading Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com) for free. Anaconda comes with all essential packages and Python. You need Python 3 (>= 3.6)
### Step 2: Install predictr package
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install predictr.
```bash
pip install predictr
```
### Step 3: Use predictr in an IDE or text editor
Anaconda comes with a bunch of pre-installed packages. Spyder is a very good IDE you can use to get started using Python.

- Open the Anaconda Navigator and install Spyder if necessary.
- Open Spyder and create a new file
- Import predictr in Spyder using:
```python
from predictr import Analysis, PlotAll
```
Now you're able to use the Analysis and PlotAll classes from predictr. For now, these are the only classes you can import. However, I will add new classes to predictr in the future.
