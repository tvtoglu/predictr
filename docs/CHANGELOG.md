All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Planned updates
### Added
 - .summary() method
 - Weibull AFT

## [0.1.29] - 2025-05-21
### Added
 - Added two new styles to the contour plot in PlotAll.contour_plot(): 'spline' and 'angular_line. These are additional styles to the scatter plot. New default is 'spline' for smoother curves through the data points.

## [0.1.28] - 2025-03-08
### Fixed
 - '1sl' attribute inside the plot is now being displayed correctly. Bug was found by bobbolous! Thank you.


## [0.1.27] - 2023-03-01
### Fixed
 - MRR based NPBB are now computed correctly. A typo in the code lead to a bug that computed solely MLE based bounds, no matter if 'mrr' was set as an attribute. A big THANK YOU to William Gandler who reported this bug and various spelling mistakes!
 - Minor other spelling mistakes pointed out by Antonia, Sarahi and Edna. ¡Viva México, Cabrones!

## [0.1.26] - 2022-03-28
### Added
 - added new style argument plot in PlotAll.contour_plot(style='...'): Currently scatter and angular line plots are supported

### Fixed
 - Boosted LRB computation by fully vectorizing each computation step and using algeabric tricks (as a tip: don't use np.power(), because it is way too slow for big computations). Now, it takes half the amount of time to have more precise results. 


## [0.1.25] - 2022-02-15
### Added
 - added show argument in PlotAll.contour_plot()
 - added customizable x-axis limits in PlotAll.mult_weibull: x_bounds=[start, end]


## [0.1.24] - 2022-01-15
 
### Added
 - In previous versions of predictr, saving Weibull plots required to plot and show them. Now, saving plots and actually showing them are independent from each other and can be called separately.
 
## [0.1.23] - 2022-01-02
 
### Fixed
 - Computation of one-sided Likelihood Ratio Bounds had an error, which always resulted in a 95% one-sided bound; no matter what was set by the user.

### Added
 - Legend fontsize can now be set in mult_weibull(legend_fontsize=9)
 - Bootstrap bounds now fully support censored data
 - Non-parametric boostrap bias-correction now fully supports censored data (parametric already did)

## [0.1.22] - 2021-11-02
 
### Fixed
 - Units in axis labels are now according to the International System of Units (SI):e.g. '[%]' -> 'in %'


## [0.1.21] - 2021-08-23
 
### Fixed
 - Custom plot title was not updating in PlotAll
 - MRR plots: pvalue was not shown when adj. ranks were being used
 - RBA now works correctly in PlotAll
 
### Added
 - Linestyles can now be customized  in PlotAll -> mult_weibull(linestyle=['-', '-.']) etc.


## [0.1.20] - 2021-04-15
 
### Fixed
 - Fixed bug that prevented custom axis labels and titles in mult_weibull()

## [0.1.19] - 2021-03-23
 
### Changed
 - Removed set_cmaps argument in PlotAll. You can now customize the colors for each PlotAll method individually using the color argument.
 - Improved consistency of method arguments throughout code: fontsizes, nomenclature etc.

### Added
 - PlotAll methods can plot median rank markers
 - Possibility to save plots for all methods

### Fixed
 - Fixed bug that resulted in empty saved plots

## [0.1.18] - 2021-03-17
 
### Fixed
 - fig_size didn't work in mult_weibull() due to a bug in the code

## [0.1.17] - 2021-03-13
 
### Added
 - Better documentation in the code

### Change
 - Minor changes to have more consistent nomenclature in the code

## [0.1.16] - 2021-03-03
 
### Fixed
 - fixed last bug in the median rank computation. Bug occured when multiple failure times were identical

### Added
 - PlotAll().simple_weibull(): Plots Weibull probability plot according to input (Weibull parameters) without calculations
 - PlotAll().weibull_pdf: Plots one or more Weibull probability density functions with fully customizable figure attributes (color, labels, width, height, fontsize etc.)
 - Added ability to customize axis labels, title, fontsize etc for Analysis() and PlotAll
 - Added ability to hide legend in Weibull plot

## [0.1.15] - 2021-02-27
 
### Fixed
 - fixed wrong percentile values for adjusted ranks when suspenions have lower time to failure values than actual failures
 - permanent fix for the disappearing Weibull probability line (see changelog for version 0.1.14)

### Added
 - raise ValueError when np_bs and p_bs bias-correction methods are applied to data that has suspensions

## [0.1.14] - 2021-02-16
 
### Fixed
 - temporary fix for instances in Analysis where the Weibull probability line disappears when two-sided bounds are used
 
## [0.1.13] - 2021-01-23
 
### Fixed
 - hrbu was misspelled in the code and raised an error when calling this bias-correction method

## [0.1.12] - 2021-01-14
 
### Added
 - contour_plot() method in PlotAll class: Plots likelihood ratio contours for Analysis class instances

## [0.1.11] - 2021-01-01
 
### Fixed
 - When using npbb and pbb as bounds, bounds types 1sl and 1su would return the same bounds limits. Fixed the percentile method.

## [0.1.10] - 2021-01-01
 
### Fixed
 - Minor fix and code restructuring

## [0.1.9] - 2021-01-01
 
### Added
 - new GithubPage: https://tvtoglu.github.io/predictr/
 - new Class: PlotAll -> plot multiple Weibull plots in one figure

## [0.1.7] - 2020-12-29
  
### Changed
 - changed get_bx_percentile() to a classmethod

## [0.1.6] - 2020-12-29
 
### Added
- Official changelog
- New static method get_bx_percentile() for Analysis class. You can now get the time values for given BX-lives

### Changed
  
- Argument "bounds" for Fisher bounds: 'fisher' -> 'fb'. This is more in line with the other confidence bounds
