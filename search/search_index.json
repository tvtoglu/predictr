I will continue to add new classes in near future. Analysis Analysis contains all necessary methods for the Weibull analysis. Default arguments and values This table provides information on alle arguments that are passed to the Analysis class. Parameter default value type description df None list of floats List of failures ds None list of floats List of suspensions (right-censored only) bounds None str Confidence bounce method to be used in mle() or mrr() bounds_type None str Setting for the bounds: either two-sided or one-sided show False bool If True, the Weibull probability plot will be plotted bcm None str Defines the bias-correction method in mle() cl 0.9 float Sets the confidence level when bounds are used bs_size 5000 int Number of bootstrap samples est_type 'median' str Sets the statistic to compute from the bootstrap samples plot_style 'ggplot' str Choose a style according to your needs. See matplotlib style references for more available styles. unit '-' str Unit of failures and suspensions, e.g. 's', 'ms', 'no. of cycle' etc. x_label 'Time to Failure' string Label for the x-axis y_label 'Unreliability' string Label for the y-axis xy_fontsize 12 float fontsize for the axes label and ticks legend_fontsize 9 float Fontsize for the legend plot_title 'Weibull Probability Plot' string Title for the plot plot_title_fontsize 12 float Fontsize of the plot title fig_size (6, 7) tuple of floats Sets figure width and height in inches: (width, height) save False boolean the beta and eta length of lists. plot_ranks True boolean If True, median ranks will be plotted. show_legend True boolean If True, the legend will be plotted kwarg: path string Path defines the directory and format of the figure E.g. r'var/user/.../test.pdf' Important : df = None will raise an error. There has to be at least one failure. Parameter estimation methods One can either use the Maximum Likelihood Estimation or Median Rank Regression. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE): from predictr import Analysis prototype_a = Analysis(...) # create an instance prototype_a.mle() # use instance methods Median Rank Regression (MRR) from predictr import Analysis prototype_a = Analysis(...) # create an instance prototype_a.mrr() # use instance methods Bias-correction methods Since parameter estimation methods are only asymptotically unbiased (sample sizes -> \"infinity\"), bias-correction methods are useful when you have only a few failures. These methods correct the Weibull shape and scale parameter. The following table provides possible configurations. Bias-corrections for mrr() are not supported, yet. Bias-correction method mle() mrr() argument value config. statistic C4 aka 'reduced bias adjustment' x - 'c4' - - Hirose and Ross method x - 'hrbu' - - Non-parametric Bootstrap correction x - 'np_bs' bs_size 'mean', 'median', 'trimmed_mean' Parametric Bootstrap correction x - 'p_bs' bs_size 'mean', 'median', 'trimmed_mean' Confidence bounds methods Analysis supports nearly all state of the art confidence bounds methods. confidence bounds mle() mrr() uncensored data censored data bounds_type argument value Beta-Binomial Bounds - x x x '2s', '1sl', '1su' 'bbb' Monte-Carlo Pivotal Bounds - x x x '2s', '1sl', '1su' 'mcpb' Non-Parametric Bootstrap Bounds x x x - '2s', '1sl', '1su' 'npbb' Parametric Bootstrap Bounds x x x - '2s', '1sl', '1su' 'pbb' Fisher Bounds x - x x '2s', '1sl', '1su' 'fb' Likelihood Ratio Bounds x - x x '2s', '1sl', '1su' 'lrb' Important : mle() and mrr() support only specific confidence bounds methods. For instance, you can't use Beta-Binomial Bounds with mle(). This will also raise an error. Use the table above to check, whether a combination of parameter estimation and confidence bounds method is supported. '2s': two-sided confidence bounds, '1su': upper confidence bounds, '1sl': lower confidence bounds. If Beta-Binomial Bounds are used, the lower bound represents the lower percentile bound at a specific time ((pctl) is added in the plot legend). If Fisher Bounds are used, the lower bound represents the lower time bound at a specific percentile. Examples Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) Uncensored sample Example: failures = [0.4508831, 0.68564703, 0.76826143, 0.88231395, 1.48287253, 1.62876357] prototype_a = Analysis(df=failures, bounds='fb',show=True) prototype_a.mle() Censored sample Example: failures = [0.4508831, 0.68564703, 0.76826143, 0.88231395, 1.48287253, 1.62876357] suspensions = [1.9, 2.0, 2.0] prototype_a = Analysis(df=failures, ds=suspensions, bounds='lrb',show=True) prototype_a.mle() Median Rank Regression (MRR) Uncensored sample Example: failures = [0.4508831, 0.68564703, 0.76826143, 0.88231395, 1.48287253, 1.62876357] prototype_a = Analysis(df=failures, bounds='bbb',show=True) prototype_a.mrr() Censored sample Example: failures = [0.4508831, 0.68564703, 0.76826143, 0.88231395, 1.48287253, 1.62876357] suspensions = [1.9, 2.0, 2.0] prototype_a = Analysis(df=failures, ds=suspensions, bounds='mcpb',show=True) prototype_a.mrr() Bias-corrections As already mentioned, only mle() support bias-corrections. The samples in these examples are drawn from a two-parameter Weibull distribution with a shape parameter of 2.0 and a scale parameter of 1.0. Uncensored sample It is appearent that the estimates of beta and eta are now closer to the ground truth values. The dotted grey line in the plot is the \"biased\" MLE line, the bia-corrected line is blue. The legend contains all needed information. failures = [0.4508831, 0.68564703, 0.76826143, 0.88231395, 1.48287253, 1.62876357] prototype_a = Analysis(df=failures, bounds='fb', show=True, bcm='c4') prototype_a.mle() The estimates can for the Weibull parameters can be compared directly, since they are available as attributes print(f'biased beta: {prototype_a.beta:4f} --> bias-corrected beta: {prototype_a.beta_c4:4f}') >>> biased beta: 2.511134 --> bias-corrected beta: 2.108248 Censored sample The data is type II right-censored. failures = [0.38760099164906514, 0.5867052007217437, 0.5878056753744406, 0.602290402929083, 0.6754829518358306, 0.7520219855697948] suspensions = [0.7520219855697948, 0.7520219855697948] prototype_a = Analysis(df=failures, ds=suspensions, bounds='lrb', show=True, bcm='hrbu') prototype_a.mle() Modifying the Weibull plot Axes labels and title You can modify the axes label, plot title and the fontsize. Also, you can save the plot by setting save=True and path='your/own/directory/example.pdf'. failures = [0.4508831, 0.68564703, 0.76826143, 0.88231395, 1.48287253, 1.62876357] prototype_a = Analysis(df=failures, bounds='fb',show=True, plot_title='New Project', x_label='No. of Cycles', unit='10^3', y_label='Unreliability: 1-R', xy_fontsize=12, save=True, path=r'var/user/test.pdf') prototype_a.mle() Figure size, plot legend and median rank markers You can customize the fontsize that is being used in the plot legend. If you don't want a legend set show_legend=False. By default, the markers for the median ranks will be plotted. Set plot_ranks=False if you don't want median rank markers in your plot. The figure size can be modified with fig_size=(width, height). Width and height set the figure size in inches. failures = [0.4508831, 0.68564703, 0.76826143, 0.88231395, 1.48287253, 1.62876357] prototype_a = Analysis(df=failures, bounds='fb',show=True, show_legend=True, legend_fontsize=10, show_ranks=False, fig_size=(7, 7)) prototype_a.mle() PlotAll PlotAll plots class objects from Analysis in one figure. Currently, only data from mle() is supported. Theoretically, you can plot as many objects as you like -> provide a list of colors as a kwarg in PlotAll(objects, **kwargs).mult_weibull(). For now, six colors are supported by default, but you can pass an infinit amount of colors to the mult_weibull() method. Available methods : Methods Description mult_weibull() Plots multiple Analysis class instances in one Weibull plot contour_plot() Plots contour plots when likelihood ratio bounds are used in Analysis weibull_pdf() plots one or more Weibull probability density functions. Axes are completely customizable. simple_weibull() plots the Weibull probability plot for a given pair of beta and eta. If failures and/or suspensions are given, the median ranks are plotted as well.
